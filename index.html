    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	This is my first programming project using java, it is a game based on a fox and it is coded using
        the City Engine Library. The main character controlled is by the user using the up and down keys on a keyboard, when the character comes into contact with a cat-burger its value of food 
        increases by 1. In order to pass the first level 5 must be collected, however for level 2 and 3 it is 10. When the fox comes into contact with the rolldog, it loses a life, when in contact with the bird it loses 2 lives and 3 with the large boss dog. The user must use the foward button to shoot at the dogs if it has collected the rat. These values are kept printed on the
        foreground of the screen. I found that using collision listeneners and creating a saving and loading method to be the most difficult part of this project.
